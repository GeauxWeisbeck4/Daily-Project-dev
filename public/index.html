            <h2 class="md-8 col">This website was inspired by <a class="background-warning" href="https://tinyprojects.dev " alt="tinyprojects ">Tiny Projects</a>.
            </h2>
            <p class="md-8 col">I originally was going to create a similar site to Tiny Projects, months ago. Things got busy, I forgot, I started my fifth Section 4 business sprint
                 - whatever the excuse is, I just flat out never did it. This has caused a problem with many of the little projects I have started myself while coding the past year.
                I've got a lot of projects going, but there are so many that get left undone. I also want to track my projects more closely so I can put myself in a better position to 
                monetize them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="md-8 col">I am excited about this project given that I had almost completely forgotten about Tiny Projects. I  made this website by using 
            <a href="https://11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator, and<a href="https://www.getpapercss.com ">Paper CSS</a>. I used 11ty because of 
            how easy it is to use and you can customize the tempalting any which way you want. I decided to use Paper CSS as a CSS framework - I've always wanted
            to use it in a project and I thought it would give this one a cute, personable look.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p class="md-8 col">Every idea I launch, I will initially try to make money off of it - if it doesn't work out, just drop it and move on. I will at least
                have the idea recorded if anyone else wants to try and implement the project better than me! Some days I may just have to do a little design project 
                or something small, just due to time constraints, but an idea a day would be pretty awesome. I would have to be successful with so many ideas going. 
                Well, I suppose I better get started so see you down the road in my blog!
